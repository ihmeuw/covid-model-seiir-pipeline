    Parameters
    ----------
    group_y
        The state of the group system on the last ODE step. The first
        elements in this array align with the :obj:`COMPARTMENTS` index
        map.
    group_dy
        The change in the state of the group system on this ODE step as
        computed by the ode system. The first elements in this array align
        with the :obj:`COMPARTMENTS` index map.
    aggregates
        An array that aligns with the :obj:`AGGREGATES` index map representing
        total system aggregates like the total infectious subpopulation.
    params
        An array that aligns with the :obj:`PARAMETERS` index map representing
        the standard set of ODE parameters.

    Returns
    -------
    group_dy
        The change in state of the group system on this ODE step adjusted
        for whether there is escape variant invasion this step.
